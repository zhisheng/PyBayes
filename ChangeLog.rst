PyBayes Change Log
==================

This file mentions changes between PyBayes versions that are important for its users. Most
recent versions are mentioned on top.

Changes between 0.3 and 0.4
===========================

* Use of bundled Tokyo is replaced by the Ceygen_ project and Tokyo submodule is removed.
* ParticleFilter.bayes() now ignores cond completely. Yell if you need it.
* ParticleFilter lost last emp_pdf argument. Pass the same object as the init_pdf argument
  to achieve the same thing.
* Test-suite no longer needs PyBayes to be installed, yay! (no privilege problems etc.)
* Build-system was rewritten so that it is no longer an ugly hack. .pxd and .py files are now
  installed along .so (.dll) files for interoperability and additional openness. Better parsing of
  setup.py arguments and custom parameters visible in the --help command.
* (C)Pdf shape() and cond_shape() functions are no longer abstract and just return
  `self.rv.dimension` and `self.cond_rv.dimension` respectively. CPdf subclasses therefore should
  not implement these methods. This is a backwards compatible change API-wise.
